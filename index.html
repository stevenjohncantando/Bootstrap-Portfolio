                <p>Hello! My name is Steven Cantando. I am from Springfield, Pennsylvania, and I am 24
                    years old. I currently work for a Logistics company called Expeditors. My duties include
                    receiving,
                    handling and documenting the shipments that come through our warehouse, and routing them to
                    the
                    correct customers.
                    <br>
                    My hobbies
                    include listening to music, as well as playing it. I love all of the percussion instruments!
                    My
                    favorite
                    band, for many reasons, is The Red Hot Chili Peppers. This band also includes my favorite
                    drummer!
                    I
                    have seen the band four times in concert, and hope to see them four more!</p>
            
                  <p>As much as music means to me, my first love was always hockey. I played competitive hockey
                    for 18
                    years. I am now moved on from the competitive playing aspect of the sport, but still find
                    ways
                    to
                    incorporate
                    hockey into my everyday life. Whether it is watching NHL games, to coaching minor hockey, to
                    playing
                    for fun,
                    the sport will always be more than a game to me.
                  </p>
